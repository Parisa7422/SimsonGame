# Simon Game

## Project Description
The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players must replicate a sequence of colors and sounds. This project was built during a JavaScript learning course to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players are challenged to follow and replicate an increasing sequence of colors and sounds.
- **Visual and Audio Feedback**: Sounds and color changes provide clear feedback for player actions.
- **Difficulty Increases Automatically**: With each round, the sequence becomes longer, adding to the challenge.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **jQuery** (for easy DOM manipulation)

## What I Learned
- How to create interactive user experiences using **JavaScript** and **jQuery**.
- Gained experience with **event handling** and **DOM manipulation**.
- Learned about **basic game development** concepts such as managing game state and logic.
